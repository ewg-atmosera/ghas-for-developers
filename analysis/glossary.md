## SAST

 Static Application Security Testing.
 
It is a method of debugging by examining the source code before the program is run. SAST tools analyze the code for vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. This type of testing is typically done early in the development process to identify and fix security issues before the software is deployed.

## SCA 

Software Composition Analysis. 

It is a process used to identify and manage open source components within a software project. SCA tools help developers understand the open source libraries and dependencies their projects rely on, and they can detect known vulnerabilities, license compliance issues, and outdated components. This ensures that the software is secure and compliant with licensing requirements.

## DAST

Dynamic Application Security Testing.

It is a method of testing the security of an application by interacting with it in its running state. DAST tools simulate attacks on the application to identify vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other runtime issues. Unlike SAST, which analyzes source code, DAST does not require access to the source code and tests the application from the outside, much like an attacker would.
